## FAQ

1. Are the Haikus configurable?

Well, sort of. Basically I wanted to avoid using any DB or anything else besides a few JS lines. To do so, I decided to store the Haikus in a text file and read one for each day based on the date I deployed this. So, for example, if first deployment was done 2019-10-23, the Haiku #3 will be sent on 2019-10-25.

2. Could have I done this better?

Yeah, of course, but I didn't want to spend more than a couple of hours working on it.

3. Are you willing to improve it?

Nope, but if you think there is a cool feature or anything you think it might be worth adding, [just let me know](#Contributing).
